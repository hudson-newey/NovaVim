# 2nvim "Evil Mode"

(work in progress)

Similar to how Emacs' "evil mode" implements vim keymaps into Emacs
2nvim's "evil mode" turns neovim into a "vscode like" experience.

## Features

- Improved and suggested mouse usage
- VSCode keymaps
- No need to worry about the different vim modes, you are always in "insert mode"
